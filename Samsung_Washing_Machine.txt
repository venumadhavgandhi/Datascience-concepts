     Worst washing machine I have ever seen. I am writing this review after using this machine for quite 2 or 3 months. It is making horrible noise during spin function, you literally have to rush and hold the machine as it's moving so horribly. Please don't buy Samsung products because they don't even bother to solve your issues after calling customer service so many times. The person came and test the machine with 4 clothes even after having 6.5 kg capacity. Then machine did not make noise at that time and they updated the issue as resolved and again same story the other day. Really frustrated with this machine and Samsung service. I have uploaded a video of the spin function making that noise. For reference.

    How does it wash?The daily use clothes for normal wash ( like work clothes or casuals ) clean well come out smelling good and soft.If you have stains( like food stains and oil or grease ) you have to either use a powder which is High efficiency ( washing machine power) washing powder for it to be completely gone or lightly scrub with normal washing powder before washing.How easy is it to operate?It is very easy to learn how to operate, even if you don't want to learn just remember two buttons power and start and it will wash clothes for you.it does have advanced features like pre soak, delayed end and extended drying called monsoon dry.Does it take right level of water automatically?Washing Machine I think weighs clothes during the start of the cycle and sets water level automatically.If you need you can also set the water level manually.Can you run washing machine in manual mode ( if you can just wash or rinse or dry)?Yes you can.How are the connections?It connects to your normal steel tap with the connector supplied no leaks and the drain goes in to your normal drain pipe no overflows.Just remember you have to place your washing machine high enough for water to drain. the drain pioe on this machine is at very bottom.How much noise does it make?In an average house with normal noise from items like fan and AC you can barely hear it.In other words if you are in a noisy house you cannot hear it working but if you are in a super quiet house then yes you can lightly hear it.Does the machine vibrate ?If it's placed on ground it does not.how much time does it take to wash?For just one pant and one shirt it takes 36 min in normal mode and 25 min in quick mode-- remember it also depends how powerful is the water flow .Can you wash a blanket in this machine?Yes you can wash easily a double or queen size blanket. if its heavy check the weight before washing.if you do wash a heavy blanket the quality of wash goes down.Should I go for more expensive machine with more features?simply put NO.If you need to wash more clothes or wash heavy items then yes if not this machine gives clean clothes as good as any top end washing machine.exceptions : if the washing machine has in built heater, front loading washing machine.Does this washing machine restart after power failure?yes.

    No useless functionality, superb build quality and good output is what defines this machine. Often we pay for lots of functionalities that we don't use at all. After all most of the time it will be used by the persons who aren't that tech savvy. I recommend this machine for general everyday users.

    I was using semi automatic washing machine.The capacity was more and was able to wash al our cloths in one short.But in this I'm able to load just few cloths (hardly 1/3) of the space of the drum.because when i load more cloths,the motor unable to rotate and it's just giving a shake. As a result no clean wash.suitsble to 2to 3members in the family.

     Dont buy this Washing machine. Service people do not have enough knowledge on the product. It shakes vigorously like a Ghost. You will lose your mental peace with this. I received dented piece first. Later 2nd replaced one is having functional damage. Technicians are unable to repair. After sales service very poor. Please do not get cheated like me. SAMSUNG IS JUST FOR MOBILES NOT WASHING MACHINES.

    It is really pathetic service from Samsung and Amazon as just after buying it has been 4 days and no one even turns up for installation. I was a patron of samsung but not anymore. Its was know for after sales service but now it is really pathetic and horrible. It feels like that you have bought an headache coz u will have to follow with 100 calls just to schedule a installation. I strongly recommend not to buy samsung and especailly through amazon. Filthy and poor service.

    The delivery was on time and in good condition.FUNCTIONALITY:This washing machine is perfect for light use. Perfect minimal options, less time consuming, good washing quality and zero noise making. I would definitely recommend this for bachelors.INSTALLATION:The installation guy came the very next day but I installed it myself on the same day as delivery (It's pretty easy), the only pain is the faucet adapter given along with washing machine (blue colour) has a very stupid mechanism to install, so instead buy a <U+20B9>100 snap-on faucet adapter (orange colour) and you're good to go. The black hard-plastic material is the rat protection panel which can be slid in through the back of the washing machine.

    I continue to be impressed with the products and services Samsung offers. Delivery of this machine was quick and they followed up repeatedly for the installation. I was at work and didn't take all the calls coming my way .... and the Samsung representatives didn't give up. We finalized a slot (1st Nov) and the person was there bang on time. He did a terrific job of explaining the features, telling me do's and dont's for maintenance and installing the washing machine. Off to a very good start.  Ran the first wash cycle and worked well. Will update with product performance over time.

    I ordered this after seeing good reviews about it. When this got delivered I was excited but when I tried washing clothes it didn't work. It was taking water and waiting for the drum to get filled even on water level 1 mode for quick wash. After the drum got filled it started to throw water out and taking water supply. It's like a never stopping thing. After sometime it threw 4C message and drained out. It didn't even start to wash clothes. This is a new product from a reputed brand, never expected this from Samsung. I returned this defective product. Very dissapointed <U+0001F615>

    consread this review only if you put water in machine manually. i do it because the speed of water is very very low from our loft tank.it works on timer (in reverse). so if your water speed is low, timer will keep on running and eventually machine will stop when timer comes to 0.it has water level from 1 to 5. let say u set water level to 3. now keep filling water manually. u will not know how much water is needed for level 3. my earlier samsung machine used to make sound when water is filled according to level set.

    The machine can hardly take the load of the blanket and the tub starts banging on the walls of the machine.  Tried complaining at Samsung Helplines however they say the machine has been overloaded. One Bed Sheet OR blanket (they have a blanket mode pre-configured) and the new machine starts to bang ...  Poor product by Samsung not recommended at all.Looks are ok but poorly built.

    I got this product at a good price during promotion campaign. We called Samsung and then asked for demonstration and installation. It happened in two days. The technician also provided us with stand and cover ( at extra price ). It was slightly costly, but nevertheless got it.Easy And Simple to use. Even senior citizens will be able to use it without hassle. Good for family of 4 people.Works silently without much hassle.

    Sure is costly. I had to work 80 hours a week for two years to be able to afford this, but you get what you pay for. I put one old t-shirt that had been my pocha for years into this and it came out brand spanking new. So, I tried that with my ripped jeans, all the rips are now seams. Am on a roll now and at this rate, this machine is going to put Zara out of business. Just as well, during these viral times, we cannot safely go out and shop, so a machine that turns every clothing item into a new one every wash is a lifesaver. The only problem is that one of my cotton shirts has turned into a cotton plant after repeated washes. I will order some land and grow cotton from now on.

    1. Machine is good looking. Color is nice and Glass door adds2. Silent operation3. Diamond drum made of steel seems to help with the washing. Previous machine had plastic drum4. Filter is easy to remove, clean and reset.5. Monsoon cycle is a great add-on but the machine did heat up during the 24 min monsoon spin cycle. We will be using sparingly.6. The cycle ending chime has a very soft tone.  Our previous machine ending chime was loud and helped with alerting us when it was time to hang clothes dry.7. The price was fantastic with the exchange offer on the older LG automatic machine.8. We are very happy with the purchase.

    This review is just after one day of use so will maybe update as necessary.Had the machine delivered yesterday, and was contacted by local installation provider today, which is very prompt and impressive since I am in a small village/town. However, I decided to install with the help of a friend since it is so easy and lightweight to carry.It did a great and thorough job of washing and rinsing with the Quick Wash cycle. It does not have a heater which is no problem since it semi-dries in the spin cycle, and I prefer to dry clothes in the sun. And also saves on electricity. I think water consumption is  probably half than hand washing.I had planned to buy the more expensive front-loading machines but decided to give this a try, and am totally satisfied as of now. This is a simple, no-hassles machine without all the unecessary functions, and looks very nice too.

    I am now revising my comments after 6months of use. The machine is working pretty well without any issues whatsoever. The imbalance has somehow worked itself out and now it functioning smoothly. Five star for its performance/ price ratio.My only concern is that it was non-returnable when I was initially not satisfied with it and requested a refund.- Jan 16, 2020——-I am trying to return it but so far unsuccessful despite several long calls.Pro :It is cheapCons:It can’t be operated unsupervised. The clothes get tangled during wash cycles. During spin the drum gets off-balance and starts knocking the machine body. It can be quite alarming.

    The washing machine working fine and has no hassles. But the installation guy came & put a dent on the side of plastic body while removing it from the bottom packing and said that delivery was poor . Then the bottom portion legs was not properly fixed and said machine is not balancing properly. Afterwards I fixed the bottom portion perfectly. The only flaw in the washing machine is the outer body is made of very light plastic and if we press at some places dent is formed. Otherwise the machine very good for this price.

    Writing this review after using the product for a month now. Its a good economical automatic washing machine. The first time I had ordered, the product that was delivered was damaged (no physical damage). It came to light only when the technician came for the installation. However Amazon helped with the replacement and the second time it got delivered, the product was perfect. So, all in all a very good product and I would reccomend it.

    I was delivered a defective product, which was detected at the time of installation by Samsung Technician. Then I requested Samsung customer care to replace me the machine as the Warranty started after installation. But to all my surprise Sungsung Customer Care executives denied me replacement and said that it was not placed properly etc etc. Thereafter, when I contacted the local Sungsung Technical Team at Guwahati for replacement of the defective machine, the inspite of taking care of the right of the customer, had not given good response and instead of giving me replacement asked me to contact Amazon for replacement. Finding to good response from Samsung, I then contacted Amazon Customer care for replacement. Then Amazon showed good professionalism and arrange for an inspection of the defective washing machine and accordingly Amazon's technician inspected the machine and confirmed it's defectiveness. And on contacting Amazon Customer care, they quickly refunded the entire value after the defective products successful pick up. Amazon, in this matter showed great customer friendly attitude. Thanks a lot to Amazon. However Sumsunge response in this regard is pathetic. Never buy Sumsung products as they are giving defective products for sell. A big ZERO to Samsung and 100 to Amazon..

    If such a heavy machine is not movable then it is worthless. It needs two people to move it a little inch. Moreover the pipe provided is so short in length ( little more than a 30 cm scale) that it won't reach any outlet in your home. Also the pipe once fixed cannot be removed.

    I was so unhappy with my previous washing machine(Whirlpool). I was very apprehensive about buying this one. I am very happy with the product. Prompt installation in 24 hours, washes clothes very well, quieter than my previous machine, different options for washing available - normal wash, quick wash, soak & wash, delicate wash, blanket. The best thing that I liked about this machine was the magic-filter. It is encased in the drum itself unlike the lint collecting bags in other washing machines(which tore off in the first year itself). It is easy to clean and maintain. When the drum becomes dirty, the eco-tub-clean light goes off and we can run the machine in eco-tub-clean mode. The clothes don't get entangled much. And since the agitator is not sticking out in the centre, clothes don't get stuck. I would recommend this machine for everyone looking to buy the best washing machine in this price range. With the offers, it came to Rs 9500 which is a steal at this price.

All the numbers available in Google don't work.This is Ridiculous. Cant believe Samsung has such pathetic products and NO after sales service.This product doesn't work. It leaves hell log of lint all over the clothes inspite of a lint filter present. Clothes don't dry properly. Cleaning is not proper either. What a big mistake buying this machine.Completely lost faith in Samsung. Big Mistake.

    Its working fine.But there is no option to change the time cycle of predefined modes or option to add a custom mode. I feel the quickwash mode should not run for more than 20min but after selecting wash+spin or rinse+spin under quick wash, its still running the mechine for around 40 min. Normal wash is running for about an hour.This would definately increase the electricity/time consumption.

    During the pandemic, they are selling products but refuse to help with installation and responds with we will get back to you when the lockdown is over which is indefinite at this point.Most products do not allow third party installation and consider it as a violation of warranty. Amazon should stop selling this product until lockdown is lifted otherwise you will just be sitting with a packed product

    I bought this machine with some hesitation, by seeing the mixed reviews obviously. But, before buying one should be clear of the requirements. If you want a simple, fully automatic, silent and cheap machine from a trusted brand, then definitely this is your buy.It performs the tasks well, sufficient for a family of 3-4(moderate use) and the best part is the cost effectiveness. I did apply another logic that, even if the machine is there with me for 5 years, the price is quite low to buy another after 5 years , so guys don't wait and stop searching.

     We were been using IFB front load for past 10 years now and now switched to this, I must say this is an excellent machine at less than half the pricePros:1. Silent operation2. Super easy to use (Even for my mother)3. Doesn't require any descal powder for maintenance unlike so many other machines in market like IFB4. The technician told us we just need to put one glass vinegar for auto tub clean every 6 months5. Before starting the cycle, the drum rotates for few seconds to determine the load and then selects the water level (1-5) automatically6. A top load without agitator and hence gentle on clothes7. Standard drying time is 9 minutes and monsoon mode with 15 minutes and 30 minutes extension are super8. Same day installation by the technician9. Very helpful customer support on phoneCons:1. Machine has a magic filter inside which the technician told us needs to be cleaned everytime after use (This is little disappointing)2. The place to out fabric softener on the top edge of the drum which goes behind the body sometimes and then we have to rotate it to put it

Writing this review after using it for more than month, excellent performance observed.Only thing bit of worry is humming sound while working is little noisy sometimes and please don't expect more features with such low cost, perfectly suitable for our triangle family.Monsoon dry function given is nothing but u will get option to increase final spin (drying) time by either 15 mins or 30 mins in addition to normal cycle time.45 mins required max for one cycle with max water capacity's, compact in sizeOVERALL WORTH BUYING !

    Positives:1. Amazon's prompt delivery2. Amazon's exchange offer dealNegatives:1. Delay from Samsung in installation2. Very poor after-sales service as the product was defective.3. Return window was closed by Amazon, 10 days after delivery without accounting for delay in installation4. Amazon did not accept any return despite multiple escalations made to Amazon as well as Samsung.5. Samsung just kept denying the defect, with conflicting messages from multiple engineers (technicians) who reported late and kept delaying.6. After sharing multiple whatsapp videos of the issue and exchange of emails, Samsung admitted that there is a defect. They replaced a valve but that has not resolved the issue.Very disappointed that we were sold a defective product and we have to live with it for next 5-7 years at least!!

    Good product, easy to use and perfect for nuclear family. Samsung installation guy came next day and did all the set up perfectly and even gave a detailed demo. Thank you Amazon. We faced issue only with delivery as we had to go and guide the delivery persons even after sending our location to them.

    I have purchased this washing machine 1.5 months back and since then I have been using this washing machine continuosly everyday. The machine has not given any trouble since then. Given below are few Pros that you can consider while purchasing the washing machine:* The washing machine was delivered on time and the product was very nicely packed with hassle free packaging* The washing machine has very easy controls and you can quickly understand and start using it without any need of demo from the company person*  The wash cycles are pretty easy to switch and the clothes gets cleaned properly* The drier function is also very good and in quick wash setting itself it drys the clothes to almost 60%* The alarm is not very loud and even the machine operates very silently during the wash and the rinse cyclesCons:* The quick wash cycle takes longer than ususal. I have used LG washing machine as well but the quick wash cycle in that used to take only 17 mins. However, the Samsung takes 26 mins to complete the quick wash cycle. Apart from that I have not found any other cons in the washing machine.Hope the review is helpful.

    Wash quality is superb. I can see that by occasionally removing the magic filter that catches so much lint and dust from the clothes keeping the tub always clean and dry.I use Surf excel/Ariel detergent liquid which gave ultimate wash results without the powdery dust on clothes nor any lint.cons: Can't regulate water level Eventhough you have set at 2/3 and your clothes quantity is a bit more, the machine doesn't consider your selection and let's more water from inlet. I feel this encourages water wastage.

    Upto now everything is good. Delivery and installation went smoothly.recieved after two days from date of order. We need to book installation separately through link sent by Amazon. Technician arrived promptly within one day booking installation. He asked whether stand is required but I said no as I already purchased one. He completed installation and demo in 30 minutes. Machine is fully automatic it will take detergent and comfort softner automatically .

    The Samsung washing machine was delivered on time and the installation process was very smooth.  I  am writing this review after using the WM for 15 days.  I am delighted with my purchase as the WM is very efficient and easy to use. The instructions are very clear. It also has a  Monsoon feature  for extra drying in the rainy season. Thank you, Amazon!

    Very good product ... Very reeasonably priced. Very easy to use. Even my maid is able to use the same . No complications and would say reasonably good wash also. When you compare to other brands this seem to be value for money with the logical functions which can be made use of without any fancy functions. A simple machine for a regular usage,

    The one thing I did not like about this machine was the fact I don't get an option to select less water consumption than it already provides in its settings of 1 to 7. But everything else is as Good as 1-2-3!! Very easy to navigate yourself even if your tech dumb! Worth the money if you're getting this for 13-14k. Oh yeah, if they did provide a cover free of cost, it would have been great!

    I already had the Samsung 6ltrs washing machine at home, but it was purchased some 15 years ago.So decided to buy this new model and i am happy with the results.I am reviewing the product after almost 2 months of purchase .Pros - Light weight  washes perfect  rinse is perfect  the function buttons available helps a lot .Cons - The Pipes given are too small , one might have to purchase additional ( i had too)overall its very good buy and does its job efficiently , brand does matter .

    Best washing machine in this range, inner drum is big enough. If you planning to buy fully automatic machine then this machine is best, only temperature control option is not there i.e. hot water option. Rest of the features are very easy to use and best part of the machine is it look so amazing, design is so smoothy type. The installation guy is also so descriptive.

    Worth for the price.Makes more sound.For better performance and efficiency on cleaning go for front load.Current bill is just 150 increased after using it for a month. Almost 30-40 washes over.While using tub wash for every 40 washes or once in a month use either white vinegar or filtered lemons 3-5 ( informed by Samsung customer care service)

    Disappointed the moment we unpacked the package. Body of the machine is cheap quality it can easily broken. So much of Lints coming.Child lock is not working properly.In case of power shutdown it’s starting again from the beginning instead of resume where it was stopped.Extend pipe is very small in size.My mom is using  LG 6.5kg rs. 16k washing machine which is far better than this.Spend extra 3k to get that instead of this.Only design of this product is good

    Delivery was on time during the pandemic. No complaints with delivery or delivery guys. Here are the pros and cons after using the product for a month.Pros : Very easy to use. Brought it for my mom who doesn't know how to operate touch screen mobile but she is able to use washing machine.Machine's sound is less than what I've expected.Good for small family use. Serves the purpose.Cons : Inlet and outlet pipe's lengths are very small and had to buy another outlet pipe.Manufacturer people offers you to buy machine cleaning powder, stand and conver for higher prices.Thats all I can think as of now.

    Honest review after installationPros:1. U put clothes, detergent, and plug into tap and forget. It'll do a nice washing.Truly automatic.2.wash quality is impressive3.powerful moter for rotation.4. Get a free surf Excel matic gift pack with comfort fabric conditioner.Cons:1. A lot of water is required.2. Takes a bit more time for the operation.And installation is totally free once product is delivered just call the Amazon customer support they will give the customer service number of Samsung and call to this number they just assign a service engineer and book a request. Later on engineer will call you for schedule timing and do their work. It is totally free.Overall it's a nice automatic washing machine. I m 100% satisfied.Wud recommend to buy.

    This is quite an unfortunate incident what happened with us regarding this product. We had booked this washing machine and it arrived well on time. Amazon has been amazing in handling the products and arranging for installation all within the mentioned time. However, when the installation guy came to run the machine it was found that the balancer was defective and he suggested we replace the machine. Since the replacement stock was not available we were advised to cancel the machine and we promptly got our refund back.However since the brand is reputed and we had quite liked the look of the machine we decided to purchase it again. Again Amazon had been super in delivering the product. This time when the product was opened it was found that there were large dents on the body which could not be corrected. We had no other option but to replace the product again.My review is for mentioning how Amazon helped us both the times..they have been so efficient, polite and so prompt in their action. It was very very unfortunate to see how a reputed brand like Samsung was delivering such low quality products to customers without even running the quality check properly. Extremely disheartened by Samsung.

    Its very good. Easy to use. Washing is good, dont make much noise. I read reviews about like its not steady or vibrate too much etc, but nothing happened with us. Its bit vibrate while rinse but it’s obvious. Amazon delivery is very good and no contact as i got it around a month ago. But desappointing thing is Samsung installation process, as they not communicate or replie even after 2-3 days. When i enquired they said i asked them to postpone which is false statement. After 2-3 request someone came for the installation, he explained the basic things but he didnt setup the exhaust pipe saying like the machine level is lower. So i need to do it with plumber who again took some bucks. But overall good experience, value for money.

    Ordered this product on 15th July. Got it delivered next day itself.But the product is malfunctioning. Suddenly stops working. Will resume if I press some button again.The technician who had come for the installation was more busy in selling additional accessories (stand, water softener etc).Amazon service is good. But the product is defective and had a dent too.I have raised a replacement request. Fingers crossed.

    I was having 6.5 Samsung washing machine which worked well for 9 years . But Samsung service was extreamly bad( They could't replace simple fuse holder, instead asked to replace complete wiring/front panel). But I liked product's simplicity, So baught similar one of 6.2 ltr.I am Writing this review after 2 days of usage.On time  delivery from amazon. Got installation service call with in a day,  Soft curved cute design, with simple buttons. works smoothly.  Quality of wash depends on quality of washing powder, does not do anything extra to clean cloths. Features and ease of use and performance completely satisfies you for the price paid.  Even though it takes 45 minutes to wash, it neatly shutdowns after washing. I recommond this for small family of 2-4.

    Product is good, value for money. However there is a problem with outlet water pipeline. If you connect the outlet pipe which is at the very bottom of the machine, to the drain pipe which if even a little higher than the machine outlet pipe, the water flows out of the drain pipe and pours used water all over the floor. The drain pipe line should be lower than the machine's bottom. Then it works good.

    I bought same machine for third time in 2 year. Every time I change hostel, I form new group and buy new machine. Cost effective. 20 people are washing their clothes.There is issue with water level indicator. It will always show to fill water till level 1 although drum is full of clothes. Then one has to manually select different water level.

    I am writing this review after using this machine for 4-5 times. Initially the first 2 washes went smooth however after that we Noticed This washing machine vibrates so badly and makes so much noise . We tried to contact customer care as well but they are not responding at all. Product is not up to the mark. We are very dissatisfied. It's just 2 weeks that we have purchased and it's showing so much problem after 2 washes.

Purchase from store after giving 2-3 K extra, Atleast u will have machine but if you purchase from here then u will have machine but it won’t run because Samsung won’t install .

    Everything is good about this machine but only two things bothers me - 1. the tub size which I had asked to change but since Amazon updated their return policy so I am stuck with this small tub size.They can only replace that too in the same model n size.2. Dry cycle : This is not as expected. The clothes still remain in damp state. Not that much drying as it was in the 7.5 kg machine that I used earlier.Don’t know if this is becoz of tub or what but the clothes only get 30% dry

Cleaning of cuff n collors  is average not superior. N one thing I don't like is fibres of clothes attached to washed up clothes in top loads fully n semi-automatic machines .I advise front load over top load in working ,in  water consumption , in proper cleaning n also whitening of white cloths . N no extra fibres attached to washed up clothes.If you can spend more money then front load is best . I have used of LG n it's fantastic.

    If you want to stay loyal to Samsung based on your previous experiences inwashing machines, then this choice is a no-brainer. Came at a decent price and quick delivery.

    I am writing this review after a month usage and I have to say that this machine is a value for money product. , I got this machine at a price of 10,700 in sale and exchange offer . It's simplistic yet had a good build quality and feels like a mid range machine which is nice for the price that I've paid . However it's a bit loudy but you would feel that only if you keep this machine in a very quiet place other wise with the ambient sound it's not that loud. So summing up my review , I would say that if you can get this under 11k go for it as it's a very well built machine.

Rest every thing is up to the mark.You can buy this machine for small family and ease of use.

    The machine is bot useful if u have a family of three. The machine makes very much noise during operation. The cycle time is also very large. This is very sub standard product by samsung. However installation was prompt. Earlier i was using videocon machine that was much better than this.

    Worst washing machine. I am writing this review after using this machine for quite 1 or 2 months. This machine doing clothes dameged. Please don't buy Samsung machine. because they don't even bother to solve your issues after calling customer service so many times. The person came and test the machine and told us that our reasech team will call you after 3-4 days.But I am not received any call from Samsung side. Then again I call to customer care he told me that your problem will be resolved 2-3  days. But problems still pending. and they updated the issue as resolved and again same story the other day. Really frustrated with this machine and Samsung service.

    Happy with the product. Here are the good and bad things.Good:1. The product was delivered on time and in good condition. Got a call from them in time for Installation.2. The product looks good and easy to use. I wanted it for my aged parents and they have been able to operate it without issues.3. The color and make is good. Easily washed 20 clothes, dries clothes well.4. Economical. Purchased during big billion days at good discount.Bad:1. Amazon no where mentioned that the pipe to be used had to be of a certain length. The people who came for installation took <U+20B9>600 to buy the pipe (not told the exact cost of pipe) and another <U+20B9>300 for fixing. Amazon should mention what kind of pipe, tap and fixing is required for the washing machine. Else, time and money is wasted.Overall, satisfied. Would request Amazon to mention the pipe and tap requirements in the specifications.

    I have been using it for the past 20 days.. Product is pretty good.Pros:-silent operation-easy control-looks excellent, stylish design and colourCons- None from current experianceRecommentations- should have provided little more flexibility in handling the operation like an additional option to set control the timing of each operation(wash, drain, dry)  by the user itself. Though the available options are good, it would have made it better....

    I ordered this machine and delivered in 2 days,,, we just washed once and machine got spoiled. No one came from service centre for 3days to repair and when he came all he said was there was a part spoiled and hence it's not working.How can new machine be defective ????I'm very upset with amazon as I m a regular customer of the same but this exp left bad remark and will think ten times to buy anything.Even while I write review it's not repaired <U+0001F622>

    there are two important comments which needs to be highlighted-1.I earlier had a samsung 6 kg top load washing machine which i purchased 12 years ago, when i got this one i expected it to be a little bigger as it says 6.2 kg but to my surprise the tub of this machines is 20-30 % smaller than the older one, which means the capacity is reduced.2.my earlier washing machine resume its operations after power cut, but this one needs to be re-configured again after a power cut.Rest the machine is fine and works ok

    Machine is very good in this price but samsung installation service was worst.I called samsung care 4 time and i also called local samsung care to send the engineer, after waited too long service engineer came for installation after 4 days.Overall product is very good but the service of installation is not good at all.

    Best product from samsung, considering rating and review its absolutely value for money.. very friendly functions to use . Only worried is about warranty,other products get much warranty period. customer can easily misleaded by all good it has, Amazon provides ,one year free extended warranty thanks to them. If warranty is oversean , best product.

    Simply a great product. Delivery team and their behaviour and Samsung installation team behaviour is very very good. They are first telling to verify is there any physical damage is there are not after that installation team also called and they came on time. I could say easy to use, value for money, regulated movement

    Most efficient top load machine at budget price. Brought for Rs.11,000 in Great Indian sale. Delivery is excellent.Less noise while washing. Also this washing machine was recommended by my brother who is a Washing machine technician. You can buy this without any second option. Note: Installation guy was asking for Rs.150 for installation but actually it is free installation. then i said i will call to customer care and confirm on this. then he said it is not required. Be aware guys.

    Delivery person carried the washing machine on his back. Amazon booked installation for microwave ..i had to chat with samsung multiple times as call center is not  operational. Received the product with big dent on the bottom , where the samsung executive agreed is big. Bad experience during summer.Update : The product has been replaced. Been using it for one week. Good for a small family. Normal wash cycle is 45 mins. Fits 4-6 pairs

Worth the value.

After washing, the main power of the machine automatically switched off. Just amazing and works very quietly. I am loving it.

    I was bit worried about purchase of this machine as I was a beginner. There were also lots of brand who was less in prize but the review of this machine was far better than others. Finally I bought it and I didn't regret so far. Got it installed by myself however tech came next day of delivery. Washing quality is really great & noise is next to zero. It is quite simple to use so big thumbs up to Samsung and recommended to all.

    Worst experience with Amazon and Samsung people. I purchased it on dec 3rd it was not working now. When I call the Samsung service center people they are very rude. And he denied to come and resolve the issue. Worst thing I have in my life was buying this washing machine. After seeing this review if Amazon call me it would be great. But still this will never happen. When we call to Amazon they says it's not my issue contact Samsung and those will never respond to it.

    I have brought 2 of them, one for my parents and other for myself. It’s almost handsfree As once you put clothes and choose your options it will automatically does everything plus it cleans real good even denims. The outer body is good and the service person will come for installation and provides guidance when you receive. I feel water doesn’t gets wasted much here it takes as much required based on load.

    The delivery happened as expected but the machine had a dent on the left hand side of the body that I chose to ignore. Had to call Samsung and schedule an installation and demo appointment. The engineer arrived and did the installation and demo at expected. He charged me an additional INR 700 for an extended water tube/pipe as the one that came with the machine was shortwr in size and he gave no bill receipt for it. So not sure if this charge was ethical. Overall I'm satisfied with the product, uses lot of water but performance is good.

    I bought this machine last year, it was delivered timely by amazon and they planned on time installation from Samsung. Samsung is just a perfect choice for your household need. It is good for use for 4 family member if washing is weekly. Service response from  Samsung is always good on time.

    This is small and compact washing machine. I use it multiple times in a day. The washing is fine but drying takes longer and mostly about 50-60% only.

    Good washing machine but bad service from sumsung. For 15 minutes installation they require 3 days where plumber finishes the whole 1 hr job within few hrs after delivery. Really disappointed with the installation service from sumsung where i feared about future service issue calls.

    The spin is the worst I have seen in any washing machine. It had problem since the beginning. Makes too much noise and stops all of a sudden. Then fails to spin again. Keeps on taking in water and draining it until you switch it off.Recently got it fixed by calling the samsumg service centre. Same problem occurrer again. It's a headache.

    I bought this for my parents and they are in their 60s, and have used semi automatic washing machine all their lives. I would say this machine is  pretty easy to use. they didn’t even need the installation person to come. They could operate it by themselves. So far no complaints from them about usage.
